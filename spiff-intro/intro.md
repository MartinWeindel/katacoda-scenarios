# First steps with Spiff

`spiff` is a command line tool and declarative in-domain hybrid YAML templating system.

While regular templating systems process a template file by substituting the template expressions by values taken from external data sources, in-domain means that the templating engine knows about the syntax and structure of the processed template. It therefore can take the values for the template expressions directly from the document processed, including those parts denoted by the template expressions itself.
